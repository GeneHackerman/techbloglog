  ## Description
  A CMS-style blog site created for all engineers to publish posts as well as commenting on other user posts. The app was created using the MVC structure using handlebars.js for templating the page, Sequelize for the ORM and express-session for user authentication so as to not allow random users to edit or post to the page without an account. 

  ## Installation
  Clone the repo, then navigate to the root folder and run the following commands on the CLI: NPM run test, NPM run seed(this is to sync the database) and NPM start(this will run the server).

  ## Usage
  The main page has three nav links; home/dashboard/login. Dashboard will reroute to the login page and you can either login with an existing account or create a new account. All that is needed is a username and password and then you can start creating posts, commenting on posts, or editing and deleting your own posts.
